# Two-wheeled-inverted-pendulum

This is the Matlab Simulink project for the inverted bi-pedal pendulum using State-Charts.

It was developed for the course "Advanced Mechatronics" at the German University in Cairo.

A [report](https://github.com/AbduEhab/Two-wheeled-inverted-pendulum/blob/main/Results/milestone3_report.pdf) for 3rd milestone was also written to present the info.
